      <h2>Class Politics, the Third Way, and <em>What's the Matter with Kansas?</em></h2>
      <h3>Ashish Puri - Jan 16, 2020</h3>
      <p>Thomas Frank's <em>What's the Matter with Kansas?</em>, published in the days after George Bush's 2004 presidential victory, speaks to an apparent contradiction: 60% of Kansans, in the heart of a Middle America "of struggling ranchers and dying farm towns", voted against the Democrats, traditionally seen as "the party of workers, the poor and the victimized". Frank describes how the Republican party -- originally part of a never-ending political "class war" with the Democrats -- has united the poor with its rich conservative base by emphasizing social issues. While this hypothesis does not fit the data, Frank still provides an important lesson for Democrats about the failure of centrism in achieving meaningful change.</p>
      <p>Frank argues that the right-wing media has reframed the class war of American politics as a battle between "the wealthy, powerful and well-connected -- the liberal media, the atheistic scientists, the obnoxious eastern elite" -- and "authentic Americans" -- conservatives. This unites the working-class with rich conservatives, two groups which are traditionally on opposite sides of the "class war". He concludes that the pro-business Republican Party, whose "leaders may talk Christ, but walk corporate", have held onto the support of working-class voters despite primarily serving upper-class interests. In other words, the Middle American aversion to a flashy, materialistic culture has been woven into a right-wing narrative which divides a Democratic coalition that once included both "Hollywood" culture and Middle America. However, the "liberal elite" are not actually warring with "authentic Americans", Frank clarifies, because "the culture business [the liberal media] exists primarily to advance its own fortunes, not those of the Democratic Party". </p>
      <p>He explains that the Democratic Party, supposed to be the champion of working-class interests, has "[dropped] the class language that distinguished them sharply from Republicans" in its efforts to shift to the center economically. In doing so, it has allowed the cultural views of white working-class voters to "far [overshadow] their material concerns", resulting in their move to the Republican Party. In other words, economic issues create the base of the Democratic and Republican parties -- labor issues for Democrats, business issues for Republicans. Importantly, though, economic issues are not the only difference in "interests" among Americans, and, as Frank argued, social beliefs can draw working-class voters away from the Democrats. Importantly, the "religiosity" of working-class voters has drawn them to conservative social beliefs. Frank gives the example of how the anti-abortion "Summer of Mercy" in 1991 helped create many of Kansas's leading ultra-conservative activists and politicians.</p>
      <p>Where Frank fails is in offering only one explanation for the alienation of white working-class voters by the Democratic Party, and the fracturing of the New Deal Coalition: cultural issues like abortion. There are other possible explanations, however: Civil Rights Era policy provoked racial hostility; both the rich and working-class whites share hostility to increased government intervention; recent technological innovation has affected class dynamics and decreased class-based voting (Bartels). For instance, the 18% decline in Democratic identification among low-income white voters between 1952 and 2004 seems to support Frank's thesis. Further analysis, however, shows that these declines are largely confined to the South where allegiance to the Democratic Party  deteriorated after the Jim Crow-era (Bartels). </p>
      <p>Election data from the early 2000s, indicates that lower-income white voters have not, in general, recently moved away from the Democratic Party nationwide, and American politics is still greatly impacted by class divisions. For instance, Al Gore and John Kerry in 2000 and 2004 performed better than John F. Kennedy in 1960 among low-income white voters. Recent gains in Republican support have come mostly from middle and upper-class voters, actually deepening the class divide, not creating a cross-class alliance (Bartels). These are just two examples of Frank posing a theory which is theoretically plausible, but does not reflect nationwide data.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, factions within a political system form as a result of people having different interests. In the American capitalist system, the most fundamental divide in interests is economic -- the interests of the employer irreconcilably clash with those of the employed. Social beliefs are attached onto the party platform to justify those economic positions, or absorb voters who identify with those beliefs but otherwise not with the party. Democratic social beliefs -- equity, universal equality, universal access to education and healthcare -- all stem from the economic perspective of the worker -- that the oppressed deserve a basic standard of living. Importantly, these social beliefs, taken in isolation, are intangible goals, applying to many disparate contexts -- disenfranchised African Americans, an LGBT community deprived of basic rights, low-income voters oppressed by capitalism. Therein lies something which can be salvaged from Frank's thesis: "movements unify those at society's bottom". Movements are the lifeblood of liberalism, turning the intangible, ambiguous goals of equity and fairness into tangible, realizable goals of a particular context. For instance, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments established a legal basis for racial equality, but the Civil Rights Movement was required to turn hypotheticals into reality.</p>
      <p>Frank's claims do not reflect the reality of Kansas and Middle America as a whole; there are many complex factors at play, and it is insufficient to distill it all down to a "culture war". However, Frank does offer insight into the danger of trying too hard to reach across party lines. In shifting towards the center, the Democratic Party loses touch with its fundamental beliefs which galvanize "movements". After all, reaching for voters who have fundamentally different economic interests or social beliefs does not generate excitement in the base. In many ways, party divisions are inevitable and necessary, and a Democratic Party wanting to better the lives of the oppressed should remember who it is fighting for.</p>
