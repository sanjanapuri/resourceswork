      <h2>Space Exploration is an Investment in the Future</h2>
      <h3>Ashish Puri - Dec 11, 2019</h3>
      <p>Society has a limited amount of resources to fund everything from social welfare to manmade missions into deep space -- and the latter is often seen as a luxury. One thing cannot be disputed, however: people are better off when we push the boundaries of our knowledge. Perhaps the greatest frontier yet to be conquered by mankind is space, and, as in the past, that exploration will yield untold benefits for people in the future. From immediate electronic response via satellite and ATM machines, to efficient water purification methods, kidney dialysis machines and CAT scanners -- all a direct result of the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs -- the challenge to sustain human life as efficiently as possible within the limited scale of a spacecraft has transformed the modern world. Contrary to popular belief, space exploration is one of the most productive uses of society's resources. Estimates suggest that every dollar put into space travel yields a net gain of ten dollars to the US economy.</p>
      <p>There is something usually missed when dealing with the "luxury" of space exploration. At its most basic level, the scientific endeavor is so powerful because its ultimate objective is undefined. To impose arbitrary boundaries on the pursuit of knowledge is to obstruct the creativity and ingenuity that underlie the process. Something truly revolutionary cannot come from creating a well-defined path based upon current thinking; great leaps forward emerge when the path is unclear and the thinking is new at a fundamental level. Thus, it incomplete to quantify the value of scientific exploration based on its cost, the economic gain it brings, or even the inventions it creates -- these are tangible descriptors for a process that, at its heart, has an intangible gain. Science is simply put the expansion of knowledge, and what makes us productive as a society and unique as a species is our ability to relentlessly pursue that goal. Every automobile, every computer, every building and every medicine owes its existence to a scientific exploration that had at first no visible justification, but steadily and ceaselessly advanced the capabilities of the human race. In the end, that is the greatest justification: we do not know what we will find, and we do not know what we must do to find it.</p>
      <p>"We have already gone to the Moon," they say, "so why go to space when there is so much left do on Earth?" I would argue, however, that there is little more relevant to our advancement as a society and survival as a species than sending humans back to space.</p>
