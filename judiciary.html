      <h2>The Judiciary: Protecting the People from Themselves</h2>
      <h3>Ashish Puri - May 11, 2020</h3>
      <p>The people, indirectly through their representatives, codify and execute the protection of their rights. However, the judiciary is the main entity which protects the people from their greatest enemy: themselves.</p>
      <p>A popular government, by nature of having election "winners" and "losers", inevitably neglects the minority's interests. As argued in <em>The Federalist 10</em>, the minority becomes vulnerable to intrusion on their rights by a majority that can act purely in its own interest. Therefore, rights exist to prevent the tyranny of a majority against a minority -- they provide a fundamental limit on the power of a popularly elected government, and guarantee some power to the minority. Stated simply, representatives are loyal to the often variable American people; judges are loyal to the longstanding American philosophy of governance, a vital part of which is protecting individual rights.</p>
      <p>On a day-to-day basis, it is not "passing a law" or "amending the constitution" that protects a person's rights to life, safety, property and religion. Yes, when there is a fundamental flaw with the Constitution or its execution, people pass a law. However, the Constitution is an extremely resilient document, and such flaws are rare. When people feel their rights are being violated, they go to court.</p>
      <p>The Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts did not state the rights of African Americans; they simply ensured the execution of rights already guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment. In a speech, Martin Luther King cited fundamental constitutional rights as the justification for Civil Rights protests, civil disobedience, and his movement as a whole:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 3em; font-size:11px">If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand ... the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they haven't committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right.</p>
      <p>What allowed MLK to seek and achieve the ultimate legislative victories were the rights already guaranteed to him by the Constitution. In some sense, these rights were just waiting to be realized.</p>
